# 0015 - Interface of Microservices
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 28. feb. 2020* | *Accepted: 04. Mar. 2020* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
To better work with data-sharing between microservices we add 2 new endpoints: `/data` and `/combined`.

## Motivation
Currently, each tool added to aSTEP has to fetch their own data, do data analysis on it and then present it to the user. However with the acceptance of 0004, adding a way for services to communicate with each other will allow for the notebook interface to become even more useful, as well as modularising the tools added to aSTEP.

## Details
A given micro service has to abide by two simple rules.

1. All microservices have to abide by the rules of the version that it promises.
2. All endpoints have to have CORS enabled

These rules are still valid for `2020v1`.

#### Versions
Current versions are supported, and should continuously be supported by the UI. New versions can be added later by creating a new RFC with the relevant changes

- `2018`: only used for backward capabilities for previous semesters
- `2019`: the original version of the new protocol, as discussed at the original steering comitee meeting
- `19w08`: an extended version of `2019`, supporting both user and developer mode in the form.
- `y19w20`: implemented the `/readme` endpoint, which is now required.
- `2020v1`: added the `/data` and `/combined` endpoints.

Future versions should use the pattern `{year}v{version}` e.g `2020v1` followed by `2020v2`, `2020v3`, etc. because the other standard is harder to read for no ascertainable reason. 

### Endpoints
These endpoints for the new version are:

 - `/info` changed
 - `/readme`
 - `/fields`
 - `/render`
 - `/data` added
 - `/combined` added

#### Info
The first big change is the addition of an identifier (`id`) that will uniquely identify different services, so the name can be changed without repercussions.

The second change is the addition of an `input` and `output` field, which will specify the types of data the service can read, and the type it gives out.

interface:
```json
GET /info
output: {
    "id": string,
    "name": string,
    "version": string,
    "category": int,
    "input": [ {
        "name": string,
        "label": string,
        "type": string
    } ],
    "output": [ {
        "name": string,
        "label": string,
        "type": string
    } ]
}
```

Example:
```json
GET /info
output: {
    "id": "knn-router"
    "name": "kNN Routing Tool",
    "version": "2020v1",
    "category": 0,
    "input": [ {
        "name": "map-data",
        "label": "Map data for routing on",
        "type": "osm"
    } ],
    "output": [ {
        "name": "routed-map",
        "label": "Map with edges marked if they are in the route",
        "type": "osm-route"
	} ]
}
```


The motivation for adding input and output is because currently, tools have to create fields that defines the query in the database, allow file uploads or allow choosing synthetic data. These fields will have to be created as multiple fields and manually implement control of it as is done with the 'Vehicle to Grid' tool.

Adding these fields to `/info` would allow this to be circumvented, and set up an easier base for allowing redirection between tools.

#### Data
The new `/data` endpoint should have the following structure, which resembles `/render`:
```json
POST /data
input: list of fields as formdata
output: {
    "<first key defined in output on /info>": <json>,
		"<second key defined>": <json,
    ...
}
```

Example where the service advertises an output called `stuff` in the `output` field on the `/info` endpoint:
```json
POST /data
input: spread_love=true&amount=100
output: {
    "stuff": <json>
} 
```

#### Combined
The new `/combined` endpoint should have the following structure:
```json
POST /combined
input: list of fields as formdata
output: {
    render: <The same output as the /render endpoint with the input>,
    data: <The same data as the /data endpoint with the given input>
}
```

## Alternatives
One of the alternatives, is having `/render`, `/data` and `/combined` all be served by `/render` with an input parameter deciding which mode it would serve in.
