# 0020 - Transportation Network Model
**Accepted**

*Proposed: 23. Sep. 2021* | *state: 29. Sep. 2021* | *Last Modification: 10. Nov. 2021*

## Summary

A general model for a traffic network, in which multiple microservices can be connected to it in a specified pipeline, where each microservices has the model as an I/O.
Is primarily structured around a standardised schema which describes the model, and a description of the different types of microservices which can be developed to use the schema.
The Transporation Network is basically a weighted graph, where each node and edge has a weight and some data connected.

## Motivation

A general model for a Transporation Network makes it possible for multiple groups to work together with a unified objective, while still maintaining the autonomous development that each group has.
Each microservice enhances the Transportation Network by itself, while the new microservice can be used in conjunction with all the other microservices, making it highly scaleable.
A concrete example would be a microservice that makes the model with data from the database, then three microservices give different weights depending on environmental driving, traffic and (only) shortest distance, which then by the end is fed into a microservice that finds the shortest path based on weights.

## Details

### The Objective
The objective is to describe a JSON schema which can be used as I/O of all microservices working with Transportation Network Model.

To do this, 6 different topics together form the basis of the Transportation Network Model, which is:
- [Component Diagram](#component-diagram)
- [The Format](#the-format)
- [Types of Microservices](#types-of-microservices)
- [Error Handling](#error-handling)
- [Integrating a valid service](#integrating-a-valid-service)
- [Example](#example)

### Component Diagram
![tnm_pipeline.drawio.png](/rfc/tnm_pipeline.drawio.png)

Each square is a seperate microservice.
The flow of the service, is that first form data is received from the UI service, where the controller creates a TNM through its pipeline specified below, and returns a `TNM as a route`.
The `TNM as a route` means that it is a TNM which is a graph containing nodes and edges, but the first node is the start node which was chosen from the form data, and each node then only consists of a single edge, until the end node is arrived at. This is different from TNM as a whole, since this references a whole traffic network, with bidirectional edges between each node (unless its a one way street of course).

The pipeline is segmented into chunks, which the Controller manages. 
- Firstly, there is a data processing step, where the Creator creates the initial TNM.
- Secondly, an amount of weighters is chosen as pr. the form data, which each change the weights of the TNM. These are then combined into a single TNM.
- Thirdly, the final TNM is put into a router, which creates the shortest path based on its algorithm.

Between step 2 and 3, an indefinite amount of other service types could be invented, and inserted in the same service to combiner structure. Instead of only annotating weights, there were ideas of enhancing the dataset with new data, replacing null values, trimming data for memory optimization, etc.
These were however not implemented as of 2021, due to time constraints.

### The Format
The format of the Transportation Network Model is a JSON model suited for being sent and received via http requests, controlled by the [Controller](#types-of-microservices). The Trafic Network Model (TNM) is the base model that all microservices should use when handling data.

In the format, the parenthesis describes if the attribute is constrained to be some specific value or should be inside some range.
Also, the syntax `...` signifies that the list can contain an indefinete amount of objects following the given schema.

The `vehicle` object signifies the object being simulated to be on the road.

The `nodes` list/dictionary is a dictionary/list<node> of individual nodes, signifying intersections where an estimated GPS location has been made. Each node contains an edges dictionary/list<edge> of directed edges leaving the node. A node represents a junction, the node weight represents the notion that a node can cause a delay when travelling over it. (A node could be a traffic signal).

The `edges` is a list<edge> of edges. An edge represents a road segment from one intersection (node) to another intersection (node). Thus the edges list represents all roads leaving the node. 
Note that the from_node is implicitly the node that contains the edge, and the to_node_id is the endpoint of the roadsegment. 
  
The `weight` attribute is a measure from 0 (good) to 1 (bad) as to how well the road is to travel. A more detailed description is found in the [Weight Combiner](/services/TNM_Combiner_WeightCombiner).
  
Data: The `data` field contained in `node`, `edge`, `vehicle` can hold any kind of data, thus it can be used if a microservice handles data specific to a certain microservice. If a microservice wants to handle new kinds of date, they need to update the [Creator Service](/services/TNM_Creator_Genesis), and make sure ALL [Combiners](#types-of-microservices) are update as well to accept the new format.  
  
This design has been chosen, since then all nodes contains each of its edges going outward (the right side of the road), whereas all ingoing edges (left side of the road) are contained in other nodes. This reduces the duplication of data, and also takes into account that sometimes the right side of the road is filled by traffic, while the other side of the road might be completely free.
  
### Types of Microservices
Each microservice that wants to abide to the Transport Network Model interface has to uphold some general criteria and some specific criteria, based on which type of microservice it is, abiding by the rule that a microservice must do only one thing, but do it well.
  
An overview of all presently implemented TNM Microservices can be found [here](/services#transportation-network-rfc-0020)
  
The (current) different types of microservices are.
- `Creator`:
  The Creator handles database access, it converts database data into the TNM model. It is the only microservice in the whole of TNM which there can be exactly only one, namely [TNM_Creator_Genesis](/services/TNM_Creator_Genesis).
  
- `Expector`:
  An Expector is a microservice that takes a TNM model in, and gives the exact same model out, only changing null values in the model to some expected value. The output should be redirected to a Combiner by the Controller. None of these were implemented as of 2021.
  
- `Weighter`:
  A Weighter is a microservice that takes a TNM model in, and gives the exact same model out, only changing the weights on the nodes and edges. The output should be redirected to a Combiner by the Controller.
  
- `Combiner`:
  A Combiner is a microservice that combines multiple TNMs into one, and normalizes the weights while keeping the priorizations made by the user. A concrete implementation of this is the [TNMCombinerWeightCombiner2021](https://daisy-git.cs.aau.dk/astep-2021/astep-6) service on the gitLab server.
  
- `Router`:
  A Router is a microservice that converts a TNM into a graph, which have a start node and end node which are only connected through singular edges and nodes.

At the end of this section, there is detailed how new types of microservices can be added to the UI controller which calls the different microservices.

#### General Criteria
These are the criteria all valid microservices must use, who wants to use this Transportation Network Model.
- Each microservice must implement an Adapter inside the service, which has two functions, to_json(internal_rep) and from_json(model_schema) (naming may also be camelCase or PascalCase dependent on implementation language).
- from_json(model_schema) should be the first process run by the service, which deserializes the model_schema, which it receives from the Controller when called, into some internal representation (internal_rep)
- to_json() should be the last process run by the service before returning the model back to the Controller, which seriailizes the internal representation into a valid Transportation Network Model schema.
- The internal representation may be as different and chaotic as necessary, but when serialized into a valid schema, all restrictions presented in [The Format](#the-format) and [Combination of Weights](#combination-of-weights) must be upheld.

### Error Handling
Currently, there is a *strict* error handling, Controller Service driven.
What this means is that any microservice in the pipeline is expected to raise an exception when it sees an error, and the Controller is expected to catch it and create a proper response to the end user.

### Integrating a valid service
Too add a new weighter or router service to the transportation pipeline the controller microservice has to be accessed. This is done thorugh the [GitLab](https://daisy-git.cs.aau.dk/astep-2021/group-11/tnm-controller) of the controller microservice. In the function called `SetupServiceObjects()` inside the `service.py` file four lists are maintained of all the weighter and router services currently accesable for the controller. To integrate a new service add the name and URL of said service to either the weighter or router lists depending on the service. After this has been done and pushed onto the master branch where it hopefully passes the pipeline, you should be able to see your newly added service in the dropdown menues of the TNM service on aSTEP.
Below a code snippet with the four mentioned lists can be seen:
```python
  weighterNames = ["Time To Traverse Road", "Traffic On Road", "Fuel consumption"]	
	weighterURLs = ["URL1", "URL2", "URL3"]
	routerNames = ["A* Router", "Greedy Router", "Deep Q Network Router"]
	routerURLs = ["URL4", "URL5", "URL6"]
``` 
  
## Example
This example shows a star junction, following a simplified TNM, where a node only contains its longitude and latitude data, and an edge only contains its street name, length, type and length
