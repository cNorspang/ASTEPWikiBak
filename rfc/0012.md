# 0012 - Server Architecture 
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 2019* | *Accepted: 2019* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
This RFC details the current server architecture and what each server is responsible for.
## Motivation
This is more of a documentation RFC, as the decisions have already been made, and the solutions implemented.
However it is quite relevant for future developers to understand the architecture and what each server does.
This will be explained throughout this RFC.
## Details
The final server setup for aSTEP 2019 can be seen in the following section

![image of server setup](/rfc/0012/astep2019server.png)

Below is a concise list of the servers:
* **Daisy-git** the server that hosts the aSTEP git repository, is still present, but now also hosts any artifacts that might result from builds. 
* **aSTEP-run01**, which is the runner server that runs unit tests, and builds Docker images. 
    It now also makes requests to create new services on the Kubernetes cluster.
* **Kubernetes cluster** was added as a way to manage the many different services. see RFC 0009
    The cluster contains a Master node and two slave nodes, which connects to *DB1* and *DB2*
    Ingress is a service running in Kubernetes, which is hit when attempting to access the cluster through ports 80 and 443 for https.
    Ingress redirects to the correct service.
* **DB1** and **DB2**, which hosts databases, which contain the data to be used by the services.
\end{itemize}

As explained in RFC 0009, the Kubernetes cluster will automatically make sure that all micro-services'
docker images are up-to-date, which makes deploying new versions easier for the developers.
