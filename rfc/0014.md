# 0014 - Documentation Style
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 27. Feb. 2020* | *Accepted: 04. Mar. 2020* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary

We propose a new system for documentation of services, consisting of usage instructions and implementation details, for respective services, as well as a seperate documentation service with implementation details for the shared services (UI, ServiceFetcher, Server Architecture etc.)

## Motivation

The current system for documentation, has services expose a readme endpoint consisting of a single markdown file with documentation. It is unclear whether this should be reserved for usage instructions or implementation details, or both. Right now many services use it for a mix of the two. Furthermore, there is no consistent style for how this documentation should be written.

The documentation for shared services, are split between the RFC list, the "Chart type Documentation"-service, as well as the odd GitLab Readme, which makes it hard to find specific documentation.

## Details

The Toggle-Button described in RFC-0005 will be automatically diplayed on all services. This button switches between "User"-mode and "Developer"-mode. This does not need to have any effects on the field displayed in the sidebar, if a service has no use for seperate fields for users and developers. However, switching to developer mode will change the "Documentation"-button to a "Developer Documentation"-button (or something similar), which instead brings the user to documentation about a services implementation. Furthermore, all services which expose an API, should have an API button, as described in RFC-0005, which should be displayed when in developer-mode, and which brings the user to API-documentation.

> Despite this RFC being accepted, these buttons weren't actually ever made. The UI's "*Documentation*" button only displays a user-oriented documentation.

For this change to take effect, either a new endpoint (for example /doc) must be exposed by services, that contain the service documentation, or the /readme endpoint must be configured to take an input such that it is distinguishable whether or not usage instructions or documentation should be shown.

The RFC list service should be changed to reflect a history of the different Requests for Comments, by providing all RFC's with a Status (accepted, rejected), a timestamp for proposal, a timestamp for acceptance/rejection (given that a proposal has been accepted/rejected), a timestamp for the last modification, as well as a reason for rejection if a service has been rejected. An example of this can be seen in this picture:

The documentation service should contain documentation for all shared services, such as the UI and how it interfaces with services (currently documented in RFC-0004), the ServiceFetcher service (currently documented on GitLab) etc., as well as documentation for server architecture, database structure and style guides and conventions currently in use. 

We propose that this documentation service, as well as developer documentation for individual services use a common documentation framework. For this purpose we propose using a Wiki-style HTML page, such as [TiddlyWiki](https://classic.tiddlywiki.com/) or setting up a shared Wiki server such as [Wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/).


## Alternatives

An alternative would be to use the RFC list as it is currently described RFC-0001.
