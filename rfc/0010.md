# 0010 - Service Fetcher
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 2019* | *Accepted: 2019* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
A service that can return all the services running in Kubernetes.

## Motivation
In order for the UserInterface to list all the available services in the sidebar, it should know which services are running, which category they belong to and at what base URL they operate.
A service could be developed for this purpose. 
The UserInterface could then send a request to the Service Fetcher which would respond with all the services that should be listed in the sidebar.

## Details
The Kubernetes cluster uses Ingress for routing and load balancing.
With kubectl all running Ingress resources can be fetched using:
```
kubectl get ing --all-namespaces
```
which will return a list of all Ingress resources on the form:
```
NAMESPACE | NAME | HOSTS | ADDRESS | PORTS | AGE
```
Example output:
```
NAMESPACE                        NAME                                   HOSTS                                                                             ADDRESS   PORTS     AGE

This will provide the host address for all services running in the Kubernetes cluster.
However, the following conditions should also apply, in order for the service to be listed in the sidebar.

1. Only production services should be listed.
2. Only user services should be listed. This means that the Service Fetcher itself, along with the UserInterface and other utility services should not be listed.

Condition 1 can be ensured by only selecting services that has the name "production-auto-deploy" since this is the default name given by GitLab, when the service is deployed to Kubernetes for *production*.
The second condition can be ensured, since we know all user services must follow the interface described in RFC 0004, which states, that a service should respond with name, category and version on the `/info` endpoint.

The Service Fetcher can now create a map from all service hosts to `{name, category, version}` ignoring the hosts, that returned anything but a valid respons on `/info`.

The Service Fetcher will expose the following endpoints:
- `/services` which will list all services found by `kubectl get ing --all-namespaces`
- `/infos` the will return the map from hosts to `{name, category, version}`
- `/errors` that will return potential errors that may have occurred during the `/info` call to the service.
All of which can be appended with `/prodcution` in order to only show production services.

## Troubleshooting service not appering in sidebar on UserInterface

1. Make sure that the Service Fetcher actually has found the service using the `/services` endpoint. If your services is not listed this means that your service is not deployed correctly / running in the Kubernetes cluster or that the Service Fetcher may be malfunctioning.
2. If your service is listed in `/services` you can check `/errors` for a reason why your service is not listed in the `/infos` endpoint.
3. If your service is not under `/errors` and IS under `/infos`, then the UserInterface may be malfunctioning, or you could be at the wrong astep domain.

## Alternatives
An alternative is to hard code links to services that should be listed. This approach comes with obivous downsides, like adding an addional step in order to publish a service, and possibly listing services that are not running.
