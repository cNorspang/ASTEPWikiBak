# 0016 - Common input/output standard for time-series services
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 9. Mar. 2020* | *Accepted: 25. Mar. 2020* | *Last Modification: 13. Mar. 2020*

## Summary

We propose a common I/O standard for time-series services, which will allow for an output of one time-series service to be used as input for another.

## Motivation

Having the same input and output format for all time-series services will allow for the possibility to pass the data between the services.  
A concrete example would be that a data-set can be checked for outliers by one service, and then the output of the service can be used as input on a different aSTEP time-series service.

## Details
### The objective
To create a common I/O format that can contain either one or more graphs in an array, allowing for easy handling of datasets with multiple graphs.  
Furthermore, having a description of each graph + the data-set as a whole is desired for visual feedback. 

### The format
The proposed format is using JSON objects of the following layout:
- Name of the dataset *(String)*
- All graphs *(Array of objects)*
    - Graph object(s):
        - Label/name of graph *(String)*
        - Data for graph *(Array of objects)*
            - Data-point object(s):
                - x *(number)*
                - y *(number)*

Having an x- and y-value is mandatory.  
If desired, then each ```"Data-point object"``` can be expanded with more data. 

*A JSON object following this standard would look like this:*
```JSON
{
  "dataSetName": "Name of dataset",
  "graphs": [
    {
      "label": "Name of graph",
      "data": [
        {
          "x": 2,
          "y": 35
        },
        {
          "x": 3,
          "y": 38
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "label": "Name of graph",
      "data": [
        {
          "x": 5,
          "y": 33
        },
        {
          "x": 42,
          "y": 83
        },
        {
          "x": 56,
          "y": 153
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
It will also possible to add additional data to a "Data-point object" for example:
```JSON
{
  "x": 2,
  "y": 38,
  "outlier": true
}
```
It is optional if the individual services want to use the additional data-points added.

### Implementation in the time-series services
It is expected that all services will be able to take a JSON string of the proposed format as input, handle the data, and then output a JSON string of the same format.  
How the data is handled internally in the service is up to the individual groups, as long as the input/output of the service follows the proposed format.  
If it desired to work with a different data format internally in the service, then each service could contain a data handler to handle the conversion of input/output between the internal and the proposed format.

### Service interface for the proposed data type
*The proposed format will integrate into the [service interface](https://wiki.astep-dev.cs.aau.dk/service-interface) in the following manner:*  
For the ```/info``` endpoint of time-series services, the input and output type of the proposed format will be called ```"time-series"```. As the data can contain multiple graphs, then it will *in most cases* only be necessary to have a single input and output of the proposed type.  

A time-series service ```/info``` would, for example, look like this:
```JSON
{
    "id": "service-id",
    "name": "service-name",
    "version": "2020v1",
    "category": 2,
    "input": [ {
        "name": "data-input",
        "label": "Input data",
        "type": "time-series"
    } ],
    "output": [ {
        "name": "data-output",
        "label": "Output data",
        "type": "time-series"
    } ]
}
```

### Integration with front-end UI
If this is approved, then group SW602F20 will implement functionality in the frontend, which will convert the proposed data-format into a data standard that can be represented visually using the existing chart-implementation outlined in [RFC006](https://wiki.astep-dev.cs.aau.dk/rfc/0006).

## Alternatives
- Choose not to use a shared I/O standard, and let it be decided on a case by case basis.
- Choose another common I/O standard for all time-series services.
