# 0006 - Definition of chart types.
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 2019* | *Accepted: 2019* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
This RFC lists the different types of chart types, and how these are implemented, as well as the output of these. 
Whenever new chart types are developed these should be added to this RFC. 

## Motivation
With a large diverse development team, we require to know how the chart types work and how to work with them. This makes development easier, and should make maintainance easier for future semesters. This should also make it easy to get a summaration of the current chart types and their possibilities, which should make sure that multiple types with the same, or overlapping, usage doesn"t exist.


## Details
This section will enumarate all the different chart types, their purpose and what arguments they require. When adding new chart types, please follow the used syntax.

The meaning of "argument" in this context, is what render ought to return to get the desired result.


### Data Types
Throughout these chart types a few different data types are used. To eliminate redudancy, these are listed here, as what they are called, and what they mean. 


| **type** | **definition** |
|---|---|
|**[string]**|any string|
|**[number]**|Any real number (decimal or integer) |
|**[coordinate-set]**|a dict as `{"lat":[number],"lon":[number]}` |
|**[geo-view]**|a dict as `{"center":[coordinate-set],"zoom":[number]}` |
|**[color]**|a string as a html color (`#fff`, `rgb(255,255,255,1)`, `white`) |
|**[any]**| type is anything. Is explained in footnotes |


### Chart Type: Text
This is the most simple type, and will simply display the returned HTML. 
The purpose of this type, is to showcase documentation or similar text-based information. This could, for instance, be a datadump. 
It is worth noting that relative links will not work as the HTML is shown "as-is".
The relative links will, when parsed by the client browser, point at the UI server, not the microservice from which they are returned.
It is preferable, when possible, to use the Markdown chart type instead, as it enforces a standardized design, but also supports relative links.

#### Arguments:

```text
{
    "chart_type":"text"
    "content":[string]
}
```

#### Output:

A visualization of the HTML.

### Chart Type: Markdown
This chart-type takes Markdown code as input, which is then converted into HTML and displayed. For more information about Markdown and the possiblities within it, see [read more here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
This is a preferred version to simply returning HTML, as it makes sure that the visualized HTML code follows a uniform standard for text and visualization.
The purpose of this type is to showcase README files, however this can be utilized to showcase any form of data.
An additional feature, compared to the text chart-type, is that relative links are rewritten when converting the Markdown to HTML.
This makes it possible to self-host images, but also link to other endpoints if your service, for example, has a download link or something else.


Naturally, you need to expose the endpoints when utilizing relative paths.
If you have the Markdown `![](my_image.jpg)` you need an endpoint on your API of your webservice `my_image.jpg`, which returns JPEG data and has the content-type `image/jpeg`.
Similarly, if your Markdown line is `[click here to download our report](statics/my_report.pdf)` you should have an endpoint called `statics/my_report.pdf`, which returns PDF data and has the header `content-type: application/pdf`.

It is recommended to read up on "serving static files" within your framework (this should be easily accessable via Google), as most frameworks has some features that can help you regarding returning files.
For example, by searching for "serving static files i Flask" I found the following:

```
@app.route("/static/<path:path>")
def fetch_static_file(path):
    return send_from_directory("static_files", path)
```

From a technical perspective, the conversion from relative paths to absolute are done by prepending the URL of the microservice if the following regex, when tested on a given link, finds zero matches: `/^https?:\/\/|^\/\//i`. 

#### Arguments:
```
{
    "chart_type":"text"
    "content":[string of markdown]
}
```

#### Output:

A visualization of the Markdown, converted to HTML.

### Chart Type: Geographical Clustering
This creates clusters on a geographical map, and was inspired/required by a project from a previous semester (2018, Hazardous Road Locations) that used clustering to display traffic collision and riskzones. This can be used to display clustering based on different geographical points.

#### Arguments:
```text
{
   "chart_type":"map-cluster"
   "content": {
      "view":[geo-view]
      "points":[list of [coordinate-set]]
   }
}
```


#### Output:

![Clusters of trafic accidents in Northern Jutland](/rfc/0006/cluster-output.png)

### Chart Type: Geographical Geometry
This *should* be able to create any geometric shape on the geographical map.
This utilizes open-layers function of taking a JSON object and intepreting it. This is inspired by a group project the previous semester (2018, Map Matching), that used it to draw different routes on a map.


#### Arguments:

```text
{
    "chart_type":"map-geo"
    "content": {
       "view":[geo-view]
       "featureData": {
           "type":"FeatureCollection"
           "features":[any*]
       }
    }
}
```
\[any\*\] = content is dependent on OL.js. examples can be found [here](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/geojson.html), [here](https://openlayers.org/workshop/en/vector/geojson.html) and the documentation can be found [here](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_format_GeoJSON-GeoJSON.html).

#### Output:

![A trained and a raw route through Aalborg](/rfc/0006/geo-lines-output.png)

### Chart Type: Chart js
Chart.js is a powerful javascript framework for rendering different types of linecharts, barcharts and other kinds of charts. These types can be used for temporal data. 

#### Arguments:
```text
{
  "chart_type":"chart-js"
  "content":{
    "data":[ list of 
      { "data": [list* of [number]], "label": [string] }
    ],
  }
  "labels":[list* of [string]],
  "colors":[list of
    { 
      "backgroundColor": [color],
      "borderColor": [color],
      "pointBackgroundColor": [color],
      "pointBorderColor": [color],
      "pointHoverBackgroundColor": [color],
      "pointHoverBorderColor": [color]
    },
  ],
  "type":[string*]
}
```
\[list\*\] = these all have to be the same length

\[string\*\] = either:

- line
- bar
- radar
- doughnut
- pie
- polarArea
- bubble
- scatter


#### Output:

![Two tabs, one with a map and one with text, which is selected](/rfc/0006/chartjs-output.png)

### Chart Type: Composite
Sometimes it is relevant to display multiple different types of data, 
for instance a graph and a datadump and maybe an explaination of the values. 
Instead of making a custom chart-type with all these values, 
you can display it in multiple tabs in this composite graph type, 
that takes multiple graphs and display each in its own tab, making 
it easy to go between the different visualizations (be it text, a map or
 something else entirely) without making a new request to the backend microservice.

#### Arguments:

```text
{
    "chart_type":"composite",
    "content":[list of 
        {
            "name":[string]
            "chart_type":[string*]
            "content":[any*]
        }
    ]
}
```

\[string\*\] = has to be a chart\_type defined in this very document.

\[any\*\] = content as defined by this document, relating to the relevant chart\_type.

#### Output:

Tabs of multiple charts, that can be switched between without making any external requests.

### How to create a new Chart Type
The current implementation of the architecture is developed in Angular. To add new chart types, these have to be written as TypeScript code in Angular.

It should be possible to implement both simple chart types without a deeper understanding of Angular, but more complex behaviour will obviously be easier after reading the Angular documentation. 

To add a new chart type, first you need to add a new component-folder to `app/src/app/charts`, which can easily be done by copying one of the existing chart types, however the file names and variables have to be changed accordingly. 

An example could be adding a folder `helloworld-chart` with files:

- `hello-world.component.ts`
- `hello-world.component.css`
- `hello-world.component.html`
- `hello-world.component.spec.ts`

where the css file is the stylesheet for the component, the html is the template of the component, ts is the behavior and spec are the specification tests for the component.

the `hello-world.component.ts` file should contain something like:

```typescript
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component } from "@angular/core";
import { ChartComponent } from "../chart-component";
@Component({
    selector: "app-hello-world",
    templateUrl: "./hello-world.component.html",
    styleUrls: ["./hello-world.component.scss"],
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class HelloWorldComponent extends ChartComponent<string> {
}
```

Where it is important to change the `@component` to have the correct templateUrl and StyleUrls and a relevant selector. The selector is the name of the component when used - so using this in a template file would be done by writing `<app-hello-world content="conte"></app-hello-world>`, where content has to be a string due to passing a string to the ChartType interface in `ChartComponent<string>` The name of the class also has to be changed.

To see examples of actual behaviour and how to write templates, please see the implementation of existing chart types.

Furthermore you need to add this component to the relevant initializers, so it is included in the project.
This is done by adding 2 lines to `app/src/app/app.module.ts`. 

1) The component has to be imported like this:

    import { HelloWorldComponent } from "./charts/helloworld-chart/hello-world.component";

2) It has to be added to the `declarations` list in the same file.

and it has to be added to the switch case handling the chart types, which is in `app/src/app/chart-view/chart-view.component.html`  

Add a line like this:
```angular2
<app-hello-world *ngSwitchCase="'hello-world'" [content]="content"></app-hello-world>
```
Where the name of `app-hello-world` needs to be the same as the selector defined in the `*.component.ts` file, and the switch-case needs to be the label passed from the microservice.


Now the chart type should work as expected. You can test this by running the UI locally while interfacing with a microservice that returns the expected chart type.

However it is worth discussing with other groups whether the behaviour already exists or if others are working on it. 
Ideally you should add a section to this document before you start implementing the chart type, to make sure the design make sense and is generalized.
This has the side effect that the idea and design of the chart type will be peer reviewed.

## Alternatives
Each chart type can be implemented differently, however the usage of chart-types, as a concept, has already been accepted in RFC 0004. New MR should be created with changes or additions to this very RFC.
