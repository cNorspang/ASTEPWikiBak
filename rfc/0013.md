# 0013 - Notebook Interface
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 23. Feb. 2020* | *Accepted: 26. Feb. 2020* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
A [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)-like interface is proposed to more easily connect aSTEP services.

## Motivation
Connecting services in aSTEP, anno 2019, is currently a tedious process. Data generated in one service must first be downloaded as a file, before it can be uploaded to a different tool. Instead, an interface could ease this process by some sort of redirection and the possibility to save user-data to the profile of users. This might also result in aSTEP approaching the usefulness of a more mature data analytics platform instead of a toolbox.

A proposed interface that could be used in place of, or in addition to, the existing 3-pane layout, might allow for more natural interconnectivity between tools. This could also lead to a more component-baseable design, such that some tools could act as preprocessors of data, which could help avoid multiple implementations of the same preprocessing.

## Details
The interface should be similar to something like what is seen in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, where a field can process a snippet of code to make some sort of display. Instead of a snippet of code, the fields of the different tools can be used.
It does not have to be a replacement for the existing interface, but could be used in collaboration with the single-tool interface.

A basic interactive mockup has been created and can be accessed [here](/rfc/0013/mockup.html) and a fuller mockup can be seen below:

Of note is the graph/data/both tri-button, which would not be included in the first version of the interface. The functionality of the buttons would be somewhat complex as new endpoints would need to be added for microservices. More info about endpoints can be found in RFC 0004.

To handle the new notebooks, a new service could be added that works with loading the tools and filling out the fields with saved data, as well as a middle-man to handle data redirection.

## Alternatives
A possible alternative to the proposed solution would be to simply keep the current GUI implementation with individual tools.
