# 0002 - Database
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 2019* | *Accepted: 2019* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
We propose the use of a single GraphQL endpoint for database access.

## Motivation
We will use a common GraphQL API for all the databases to make it easier for the groups next semester and give them more choices of languages compared to the Java library used to access the databases from the previous years.
This will also simplify the handover document, because all the databases implement the same interface.

## Details
The structure of the databases is shown in the diagram below

### Running the db-resolver project

To run the project, either build the docker image and run it or run it locally.

Docker (example commands):

1. `docker build -t astep-2019/db-resolver .`
2. `docker run -p 5000:5000 astep-2019/db-resolver:latest`

Locally (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)):

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` / `npm run dev`

Note: `npm run dev` watches for file changes, automatically restarting when they occur.

#### dotenv files
[Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) makes it easier to work with environment variables locally.
Basically, you create a file: `.env`, in which you place the relevant environment variables.

Example:
```
OSM_DATABASE=mysupersecretpassword
```

`.env` should _not_ be placed in source control, and is just a convenience for local development.
The program will also run fine without any .env file.

### Add your project

To add your endpoints to GraphQL, follow these steps:

1. Add the types you need in the `buildSchema` function call in `app/server.js`.
2. Add your endpoints as methods in `app/resolver.js` and put them in a region, to structure the file a bit.
3. Add a connector to your database to the `app/db-connector.js` and create a client in `app/server.js`.

Remember that the id or ids are available on the class via

```js
this.id
this.ids
```

### Adding new database to the server
Ask a member from a server group (group 1 or 5) for access to the db2-server (db2-astep.cs.aau.dk)
He will create a user for you with the first part of your student email as username (e.g. mhsv16) and the password 'PleaseChangeThisWhenYouLogin'
You have to be connected to AAU-1x or via AAU's VPN before you continue.

Connect to the server via ssh:
  `username@db2-astep.cs.aau.dk`
  
Change your password to the db server:
  `passwd`

Open the postgres interface:
  `sudo -u postgres psql`

Create your a user for your database:
  `postgres=# create user myuser with encrypted password 'mypass';`

Create your database:
  `postgres=# create database mydb with owner myuser;`

Exit postgres:
  `postgres=# \q`

Disconnect from the database server:
  `exit`

Connect to the database with your favourite SQL program with:
```
Host: db2-astep.cs.aau.dk
Port: 5432
Database: mydb
User: myuser
Password: mypass
```

Now, you are ready to type your SQL commands for creating the tables in your database.

## Alternatives
Direct access to the database
