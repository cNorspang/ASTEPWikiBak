# 0008 - Service Documentation
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 2019* | *Accepted: 2019* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
This RFC proposes a solution for documenting our services.

## Motivation
We want it to be easy to add documentation to the service.
We want all the documentation to be fairly similar, while still being flexible enough to accommodate every groups needs for documentation.

## Details
The documentation will be shown when clicking on the 'API documentation'-button.
The documentation is fetched from the `/README/` endpoint. Ideally this endpoint can simply return the `README.md` file from the project repository. This is up to the specific implementation. (See RFC-0006, MARKDOWN-charttype)
The returned value from the `/README/` should be a JSON dict:

	{
		'chart_type': [some string]
		'content': [some object]
	}

In the same way as the `/render/` endpoint (see RFC-0006 for more info).

The README must be have the following sections:
- Purpose of service
- Quickstart
- Input/Output

Additionally, the following sections can be added if necessary:
- Miscellaneous
- Related links

### Structure
The readme should contain the following sections, if possible. Preferably rendered as markdown, however other chart types are acceptable as well.

#### Purpose of service
This section should be a short description of the service.
The section should describe the contents of the service in broad terms.

#### Quickstart
This section should give an overview of how to use the service.
It should function as a short guide to what functionality exists and how to use it.

#### Input/Output
This section should describe what input can be given and what output is expected with the given input.
Information about specific constraints/format of the input and output should also be specified here.

#### Miscellaneous
This section is for further details if necessary.
If anything needs to be specified or explained more thoroughly, it should be done in this section.

#### Related links
This section is for relevant links for the service.
For example, link(s) to the documentation of the libraries used for analysis.

### Tips
It is recommended to use the Markdown chart-type. 
If this chart-type is utilized, relative paths for images are possible, making it possible to utilize locally hosted images (see RFC-0006 for more info). 
If this is utilized, it is possible to include the README.MD as shown on GitLab, by adding `ADD README.MD README.MD` to the DockerFile (and doing the same for all static files linked) and then simply returning that from an endpoint as a static file. This makes it easier to avoid duplicate code. DO OBSERVE that this requires the relative image paths in the README to be exactly the same for both enpoints as well as file locations. so if the Markdown contains `![](readme_images/graph.png)`, the folder `readme_images` has to include the file both in the repository as well as the URL `readme_images/graph.png` parsed by the web service, should return the same image. 


## Alternatives
Each group can manually create it through the form, which is generated from the `/fields/` endpoint, where it could be returned by the `/render/` endpoint through either the HTML chart type or the markdown chart type.
