# 0005 - UI Style Guide
**Accepted** 

*Proposed: 2019* | *Accepted: 2019* | *Last Modification: 04. Mar. 2020*

## Summary
This RFC proposes the UI style guide that every group should conform to.

## Motivation
The current aSTEP user interface design lacks uniformity. 
The content of the current aSTEP website contains a lot misalignments with the buttons and the asthetics of the interface lacks consistency. 

## Details

For these two font families, the allowed fonts are in this order:

font-family-sans-serif: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";

font-family-monospace: SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace;

### Sidebar
The sidebar shows the current projects, which are sorted into their respective categories. The design is kept as it is.

### Control Panel
There is one control panel for each project. The control panel acts as an area to navigate and provide user input to the web service.

#### Buttons
This defines the default button.
Unless a button is further defined under this sections, the following rules apply to every button.
All subsections under this section is a specialized form of the default button, e.g. ``` Button: API-Button ``` means that ```API-Button``` has all properties of ```Button``` in addition to more or modified versions of exisiting properties related to ```Buttons```.
