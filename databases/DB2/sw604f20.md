This database was created by group *SW604F20* during the Spring 2020 semester, with the assumed goal of storing functional models for use by the service [Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://wiki.astep-dev.cs.aau.dk/services/time-series-outlier-detection).

The database contains two schemas:
- YAHOO
- public
	- This schema contains no tables.

## The YAHOO schema
This schema contains a single table: `real_1`.
| Column name | Type             | Explanation |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| timestamp   | INTEGER          | Assumed to be the time of the measurement ofthe value     |
| value       | DOUBLE PRECISION | The measured value     |
| is_anomaly  | BOOLEAN          | Whether the value is an outlier or not.     |

Additional models can be found in the form of `.csv` files on the service [itself](https://daisy-git.cs.aau.dk/astep-2020/time-series-anomaly-detection/-/tree/master/models).
