The *sw603f20* database was created by group *sw603f20* during the Spring 2020 semester for the service [Time Series Forcasting with TCN](/services/time-series-forecasting). The purpose of the database is to store computed models so that they may be reused at a later time.

It contains a single table `models`. This table has the following structure:
| Column name | Type         | Explanation                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| <u>name</u> | VARCHAR(255) | The unique name of the model     |
| file        | BYTEA        | Binary data representing a model |

Beware that querying this table is an expensive action, due to the size of the binary data stored in `file`.
