The database *sw603f19* was made during the Spring 2019 semester by the group *sw603f19* for their service of the same name. The service is focused on analyzing data related to the movement of exe-skeletons.

The database contains the following 16 tables:

- c_data
- calibration
- calibrationmeasurement
- classification
- datameasurement
- dataset
- knn
- layers
- m_data
- model
- nn
- sensor
- sensorcalibration
