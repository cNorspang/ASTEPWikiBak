### What is your groupâ€™s progress since last meeting? Any progress on milestones? Has your plans changed? Are you on schedule? What are your obstacles?

- Group 1: Report writing and implementation. Partly solved 2 of 5 milestones. Plans unchanged and on schedule.
- Group 2: Doing okay. Impl comming along. A bit behind on report writing. Plan has changed due to misunderstanding the model, which needs to be corrected. Potential missing functionality of model.
- Group 3: Found a proper way to find correlation between sets of data. created a training model. Doing implementation and writing report about said implementation.
- Group 4: Report is comming along nicely. Supervisor helped out with implementation (Had too many neurons in the hidden layers). Making good progress.
- Group 5: Finally caught up on report writing. Implementation of models.
- Group 6: Lot of development. Working in two teams, resulting in increased pace. Up to date on report writing. 

### How can we overcome these obstacles? What measures do we take to catch up with the plan?

- *Nothing to talk about.*
