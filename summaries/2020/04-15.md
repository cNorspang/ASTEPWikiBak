### What is your groupâ€™s progress since last meeting? Any progress on milestones? Has your plans changed? Are you on schedule? What are your obstacles?

- Group 1: Report writing, research, and implementation. We now have the vast majority of the information needed to complete finish our project and milestones. Almost completed one milestone (implementing a multi-point routing). Plans remain the same. We are mostly on schedule. No major obstacles.
- Group 2: Going well. Found out how to do predictions/inference on all possible input. Added auto-encoder to model. Missing tests, but everything should work. No major obstacles.
- Group 3: Continuing with implementing everything. Found major flaw in dataset, but have fixed it. On schedule. No major obstacles.
- Group 4: Progress limited by holiday, but written report and continued implementation. Issues with model, which will be discussed with supervisor soon.
- Group 5: Decided on design of implementation of task 2 prediction, and begun implementation thereof.
- Group 6: Used most of the holiday on reading about FMU. Changing focus from UPPAAL to statistical modelling.

### How can we overcome these obstacles? What measures do we take to catch up with the plan?

- Group 1: 
- Group 2: 
- Group 3: 
- Group 4: Will talk with supervisor about issue. Can try to ask the other groups to see if any of them have some ideas.
