# Wind Speed Predictor
Introduction to the service. Who made it in the first place and when was it made? Why was it made (what is the "context" of the service) and what does it do? This should be more in-depth than in the user documentation.

## Current status
An overview of the service's capabilities, problems/bugs, future works, status of codebase, etc. How is this service linked to other services?

What do the user-mode and developer-mode fields signify and how do they relate to the inner workings of the system?
What kind of data should be inputted and when?
What kinds of output is supported and what are these outputs? Show some example inputs to the developer fields if necessary.

## Inner workings
This should be a developer oriented guide. Link to the service's GitLab repository.
What programming language, frameworks, and libraries are used?

Mention all the things important to gain an understanding of the system.
What algorithms are used? What are the core principles? What are the important classes/structures? How does the system architecture look? How does the service communicate with other parties?

## History
The following (level 3) sections should describe the history of and changes made to the service thoughout various semesters. That is, document how different project groups have contributed to the service during different semesters.

NOTE: It does not matter whether the newest or oldest semester is mentioned first. The semesters must be ordered though.

### Semester a
What project group has created or made changes to the service and which project report documents these changes in full?

What are the (significant) contributions in this semester? Descibe them in a way that gives new developers an overview over the contributions and their workings. Describe system design and if necessary the structure and code of the implementation.

Mention important facts, considerations, circumstances, or topics.

Mention future works, problems, or the sort. Conclude on the semester and contributions.

### Semester b
Same structure and content as Semester a.
