<h1>Electricity Price Predictor</h1>
<p>The microservice was created in 2021 by cs-21-sw-5-08. In order to predict electrictricity prices using the microservice, the user will have to upload a CSV file with data formatted in the correct way as seen in here LINK.<br>The microservice can predict up to X days, and the user can choose between multiple prediction methods such as SARIMAX, ARIMA.</p>

<h2>Inner Workings</h2>
<p>The microservice was created using Python, to host the back-end the Flask framework was chosen. Furthermore some python packages to help predict the electricity, primarily the statsmodels library (can be found <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html">here</a>) has been used, as it was a widely used and supported time-series analysis package. The SARIMAX class was the driving factor of the microservice as it allowed for predictions, while also accounting for seasonality.</p>
<p>The repository for the microservice can be found at: <a href="https://daisy-git.cs.aau.dk/astep-2021/astep8">Electricity Price Prediction GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="www.sqlalchemy.org">SQLAlchemy </a>ORM was used to establish connection to the aSTEP database. &nbsp;</p>
